	abstract = {Recently several different deep learning architectures have been proposed that take a string of characters as the raw input signal and automatically derive features for text classification. Few studies are available that compare the effectiveness of these approaches for character based text classification with each other. In this paper we perform such an empirical comparison for the important cybersecurity problem of DGA detection: classifying domain names as either benign vs. produced by malware (i.e., by a Domain Generation Algorithm). Training and evaluating on a dataset with 2M domain names shows that there is surprisingly little difference between various convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) based architectures in terms of accuracy, prompting a preference for the simpler architectures, since they are faster to train and to score, and less prone to overfitting.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we assess the viability of transformer models in end-to-end InfoSec settings, in which no intermediate feature representations or processing steps occur outside the model. We implement transformer models for two distinct InfoSec data formats - specifically URLs and PE files - in a novel end-to-end approach, and explore a variety of architectural designs, training regimes, and experimental settings to determine the ingredients necessary for performant detection models. We show that in contrast to conventional transformers trained on more standard NLP-related tasks, our URL transformer model requires a different training approach to reach high performance levels. Specifically, we show that 1) pre-training on a massive corpus of unlabeled URL data for an auto-regressive task does not readily transfer to binary classification of malicious or benign URLs, but 2) that using an auxiliary auto-regressive loss improves performance when training from scratch. We introduce a method for mixed objective optimization, which dynamically balances contributions from both loss terms so that neither one of them dominates. We show that this method yields quantitative evaluation metrics comparable to that of several top-performing benchmark classifiers. Unlike URLs, binary executables contain longer and more distributed sequences of information-rich bytes. To accommodate such lengthy byte sequences, we introduce additional context length into the transformer by providing its self-attention layers with an adaptive span similar to Sukhbaatar et al. We demonstrate that this approach performs comparably to well-established malware detection models on benchmark PE file datasets, but also point out the need for further exploration into model improvements in scalability and compute efficiency.},

However, these classifiers provide a false sense of security as they are heavily biased and allow for trivial detection bypass. In this work, we leverage explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods to analyze the reasoning of deep learning classifiers and to systematically reveal such biases. We show that eliminating these biases from DGA classifiers considerably deteriorates their performance. Nevertheless we are able to design a context-aware detection system that is free of the identified biases and maintains the detection rate of state-of-the art deep learning classifiers. In this context, we propose a visual analysis system that helps to better understand a classifier’s reasoning, thereby increasing trust in and transparency of detection methods and facilitating decision-making.},

	abstract = {Domain generation algorithms (DGA) provide methods that use specific parameters as random seeds to generate a large number of random domain names for preventing malicious domain name detection, which greatly increases the difficulty of detecting and defending botnets and malware. State-of-the-art models for detecting algorithmically generated domain names are generally based on the principle of analyzing the statistical characteristics of the domain name and building a classifier to locate the algorithmically generated ones. However, most current models have problems of requiring the manual construction of feature sets for classification, as they are sensitive to the imbalance of the sample distribution in the domain name dataset and are difficult to adapt to frequent changes of the domain-name algorithm. To address this issue, we propose a hybrid model that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long-term memory network (BLSTM). First, to solve the problem of the number of domain names generated by DGAs being relatively small and the sample distribution being unbalanced, which consequently decreases detection accuracy, the borderline synthetic minority over-sampling technique is employed to optimize the sample balance of the domain name dataset. Second, a hybrid deep neural network that combines CNN and BLSTM is introduced to extract the semantic and context-dependency features from the domain names. The experimental results from different domain-name datasets demonstrate that the proposed model achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art models with regard to precision and robustness.},

	abstract = {Botnets often use domain generation algorithms (DGA) to connect to a command and control (C2) server, which enables the compromised hosts connect to the C2 server for accessing many domains. The detection of DGA domains is critical for blocking the C2 server, and for identifying the compromised hosts as well. However, the detection is difficult, because some DGA domain names look normal. Much of the previous work based on statistical analysis of machine learning relies on manual features and contextual information, which causes long response time and cannot be used for real-time detection. In addition, when a new family of DGA appears, the classifier has to be re-trained from the very beginning. This paper presents a deep learning approach based on bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model for DGA domain detection. The classifier can extract features without the need for manual feature extraction, and the trainable model can effectively deal with new unknown DGA family members. In addition, the proposed model only needs the domain name without any additional context information. All domain names are preprocessed by bigram and the length of each processed domain name is set as a value longer than the most samples. Bidirectional LSTM model receives the encoded data and returns labels to check whether domain names are normal or not. Experiments show that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches and is able to detect new DGA families reliably.},

This greatly increases the difficulty of detecting and defending against botnets and malware. Traditional models for detecting algorithmically generated domain names generally rely on manually extracting statistical characteristics from the domain names or network traffic and then employing classifiers to distinguish the algorithmically generated domain names. These models always require labor intensive manual feature engineering. In contrast, most state-of-the-art models based on deep neural networks are sensitive to imbalance in the sample distribution and cannot fully exploit the discriminative class features in domain names or network traffic, leading to decreased detection accuracy. To address these issues, we employ the borderline synthetic minority over-sampling algorithm (SMOTE) to improve sample balance. We also propose a recurrent convolutional neural network with spatial pyramid pooling (RCNN-SPP) to extract discriminative and distinctive class features. The recurrent convolutional neural network combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bi-directional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) to extract both the semantic and contextual information from domain names. We then employ the spatial pyramid pooling strategy to refine the contextual representation by capturing multi-scale contextual information from domain names. The experimental results from different domain name datasets demonstrate that our model can achieve 92.36\% accuracy, an 89.55\% recall rate, a 90.46\% F1-score, and 95.39\% AUC in identifying DGA and legitimate domain names, and it can achieve 92.45\% accuracy rate, a 90.12\% recall rate, a 90.86\% F1-score, and 96.59\% AUC in multi-classification problems. It achieves significant improvement over existing models in terms of accuracy and robustness.},

AGDs can be broken down into two categories: character-based domains and wordlist-based domains. Recently, methods based on machine learning and deep learning have been widely explored. However, much of the previous work perform well in detecting one kind of DGA families but poorly in classifying another kind. A general detection system which is applicable to both kinds of domains still remains a challenge. To address this problem, we propose a novel real-time detection method with high accuracy as well as high coverage. We ﬁrst convey a domain name into a sequence of word-level or character-level components, then design a deep neural network based on temporal convolutional network to extract the implicit pattern and classify the domain into two or more categories. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both binary classiﬁcation and multi-class classiﬁcation, and shows a good performance in detecting different kinds of DGAs. Besides, the high training efﬁciency of our model makes it adjust to new malicious domains quickly.},

To address these issues, we utilize multitask learning and design a novel RNN-based model that learns to discriminate between classes while simultaneously learning to generate the fMRI time-series data. Employing the long short-term memory (LSTM) structure, we develop a discriminative model based on the hidden state and a generative model based on the cell state. The addition of the generative model constrains the network to learn functional communities represented by the LSTM nodes that are both consistent with the data generation as well as useful for the classification task. We apply our approach to the classification of subjects with autism vs. healthy controls using several datasets from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange.
